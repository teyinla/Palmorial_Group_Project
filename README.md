# Palmorial_Group_Project
This analysis is based on gender-related issues within Palmorial Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria.

This analysis was carried out using PowerBI. The project aimed to answer the following problems:

<ol>
   <li>What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to
regions and departments</li>
  <li>Show insights on ratings based on gender</li>
  <li>Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a
gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and
regions that should be the focus of management</li>
  <li>A recent regulation was adopted which requires
manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of
$90,000</li>
- Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
- Show pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of
$10,000. For example: How many employees fall into a band of
$10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000 etc. Also, visualize this
by regions
<li> Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual
employees</li>
- Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees
(salary inclusive of bonus)
- Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
